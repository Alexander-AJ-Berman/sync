# sync

## A re-implementation of my Hack @ Brown 2018 project.

At the moment, the application simply syncs your Spotify with whatever I'm listening to! See additional features coming soon below.

Engineering to-do's:
    - Break down room creation and storage of host's access tokens as efficiently as possible

Longer term for UX:
    - Open Spotify app (or web player) for the user, right now they have to open Spotify themselves.
